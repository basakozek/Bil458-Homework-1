This simple Java program is designed to create a left triangle star pattern. It uses nested loops to print the pattern based on the specified number of rows.

You can download the program as a zip. After that take the program folder out of the zip and run it with your preffered Java IDE

Default value for numberOfRows is 5 in the code. Feel free to experiment with different values to see various triangle sizes.
