This simple Java program is designed to create a left triangle star pattern. It uses nested loops to print the pattern based on the specified number of rows.

Here's an example of the output for numberOfRows = 5:
          *
        * *
      * * *
    * * * *
  * * * * *
Feel free to experiment with different values for numberOfRows to see various triangle sizes.
